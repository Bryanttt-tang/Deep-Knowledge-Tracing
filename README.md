# DeepKnowledgeTracing-DKT-Pytorch
source code for the paper Deep Knowledge Tracing. http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/papers/deepKnowledgeTracing.pdf
These source code is implemented with pytorch deep learning framework

we pad the short question sequence with zero vector. 

# We will provide a more efficient implementation of DKT by utilizing GPU.

# Runing
download the source code and the dataset, you can run it under DKT folder as:
> python run.py
